/**
 * The swap point.
 *
 * Every resource below is backed by the Express API through `./http/resource`,
 * which builds the five `Resource<T>` methods from a base path. Nothing outside
 * this directory knows where the data comes from — the contract in `./types` is
 * what the features are written against, which is why the cut over from the
 * localStorage mock in `./mock` touched only these files.
