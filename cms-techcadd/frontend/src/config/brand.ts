/**
 * Who this CMS belongs to.
 *
 * There is more than one techcadd install, and more than one checkout of this
 * code on a developer's machine. An admin who cannot tell at a glance which
 * branch's website they are editing is one careless afternoon away from
 * publishing one branch's fees to another branch's site — so the branch is named
 * in the sidebar, on the sign-in page and in the browser tab, not left implied.
 *
 * One constant rather than the same words typed into four components: those
 * drift, and a half-renamed CMS is more confusing than an unnamed one.

 * This checkout was forked from the Jalandhar one and still said so, which is
