/**
 * The optional picture and video for one section of the course page.
 *
 * Sits inside the section it belongs to, under the fields that were already
 * there — not on a page of its own. Which is the point: an editor writing the
 * "Why this programme" copy should be able to attach its picture without going
 * anywhere else, and should be able to ignore both boxes entirely.
 *
 * Both are optional and independent: image only, video only, both, or neither.
 * A section with neither renders exactly as it does today.
 *
 * Alt text is not asked for here. It lives on the file in the media library —
 * the same rule the course thumbnail has always followed — so one description
 * serves every place the picture is used rather than drifting between them.
