/**
 * Do the two halves of the preview protocol still agree?
 *
 * The CMS and the website do not share a module graph, so the constants that
 * name each postMessage exist twice. Nothing enforces that the copies match,
 * and the failure when they drift is silent in the worst way: the pane posts a
 * draft, the frame is listening for a different string, and the preview simply
 * shows nothing — no error in either console, because neither side did
 * anything wrong on its own.
 *
 * That is not hypothetical. The website's half did not exist at all until it
 * was written, and the pane had been framing a 404 ever since it shipped.
 *
 * Run: npm run check:protocol

  Here they sit side by side under one parent, so the old path resolved to a
  file that has never existed and the checker reported the protocol broken on
  every run, which is the fastest way to teach people to ignore a checker.

  Overridable, because the two are separate repositories and somebody will
