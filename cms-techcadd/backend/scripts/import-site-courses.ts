/**
 * Puts every course the website already renders into the CMS.
 *
 * FOR THE JALANDHAR SITE, NOT THIS ONE. Run `npm run db:import-phagwara`
 * instead — see the note on the imports below.
 *
 * Why this exists
 * ---------------
 * The site knows 52 courses across three segments, but they live in
 * `lib/course-pages.ts` and `lib/course-specs.ts` — TypeScript only a developer
 * can edit. The CMS held two. So an admin looking at the Courses list saw two
 * rows and no way to touch the other fifty, even though every one of them has a
 * live page with a heading, a tagline, a tool list and a careers list that
 * someone in the office might reasonably want to change.
 *
 * This reads the same registry the website reads and writes one CMS row per
 * course. After it runs, the CMS is the editing surface for all of them:
 * `withCmsPrecedence` already hands an edited field back to the editor, so a
 * change here reaches the page.
 *
 * Idempotent. Matched on `segment` + `slug`, which is how the site looks a
 * course up. An existing row is left exactly as it is — this seeds the ones
 * that are missing, it never overwrites work an editor has already done.
 *
 * Usage
 * -----
 *   cd cms-techcadd/backend
 *   npm run db:import-courses
 *
 *   DRY_RUN=1 npm run db:import-courses    # report only, write nothing

// NOT THIS DEPLOYMENT'S WEBSITE. These two paths are `lib/course-pages.ts` and

// ERR_MODULE_NOT_FOUND before any of its own code executes.
//
// It is kept rather than deleted because the CMS codebase is shared between

// `npm run db:import-phagwara`. See the note there.
